# Contact-Management-System
A Contact Management System is an application designed to store and manage contact information, such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

Here's a brief overview of how the program works:

- Contact Class: represents a single contact with attributes such as name, phone, and email.
- ContactManager Class: manages a list of contacts and provides methods to add, view, update, and delete contacts.
- Main Function: displays a menu and handles user input to perform actions on contacts.

To run the program, simply copy the code into a Python environment and then use the menu to manage contacts.
